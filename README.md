**Hi there, my name is Maren Johnson.** ðŸŒž
- I'm an Account Manager at an insurance brokerage company and in my free time I've been teaching myself various tools used for data analysis. ðŸ“Š I'm interested in using healthcare claims data to identify condition trends and spending patterns among large populations. I find the outcomes that can be found in this data is impactful on healthcare insitutions, healthcare users, and policy makers. I want to learn how to pull out important and focused questions when being faced with a big set of data, and develop a processes to digest multi-faced problems. ðŸŽ¯
  
- I'm currently learning SQL using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Python, and Microsoft Power BI. I am experienced in Microsoft Excel, although there are always more skills I would like to learn. I'm looking for mentors and collaborators who can guide me in my exploration of data analytics.
